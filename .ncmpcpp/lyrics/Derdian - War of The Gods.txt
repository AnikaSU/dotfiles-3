Day by day I killed my fragile life
Trying to be so strong and glorious
My eyes shined like the starlight
But my heart now is too far from home

I lose my mind I have lost my own soul
I cried for my love, now I'm fighting alone
Into the black night I' m searching for you

Goddess won't you save my soul!

Now I'm hearing the call of the war
You mohzer will die into the storm
I'll be giving my soul and
I'll suffer no more
Is the war of the gods

Dreaming to the night to hear his scream
But fighting for the day and by his side
God's the only one to know the way I feel
Now across the rainbow I can ride

I lose my mind I have lost my own soul
I cried for my love, now I'm fighting alone
Into the black night I' m searching for you

Goddess won't you save my soul!

Now I'm hearing the call of the war
You mohzer will die into the storm
I'll be giving my soul and
I'll suffer no more
Is the war of the gods
