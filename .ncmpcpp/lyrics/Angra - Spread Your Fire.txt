Woke up to life not long ago
You think your mind is in control?
God will take it back someday

It's not so hard to understand
They say the world has good and bad
Father Universe brings Love and Hate

Glorious - You'll lead the way
To free the world from these chains
Glorious - Your story now begins, Oh!
Fire!

Unleash the angel of the Light
Thank him for bringing us to life
Lucifer is just a name!

We are the only ones to blame
Just look around, I'm not insane!
Satan is a child of our God

Glorious - Don't be afraid
To lead the way with thy sword
Glorious - You are the chosen one. Go!

Spread your fire (Salve ara, salve victima)
Spread your fire (De passionis gloria)
Spread your fire (Et morte vitam reddidit)
Spread your fire (Qua vita mortem pertulit)

Glorious - Don't be afraid
To lead the way with thy sword
Glorious - You are the chosen one. Go!

Spread your fire (Salve ara, salve victima)
Spread your fire (De passionis gloria)
Like a dragon spread your fire (Qua vita mortem pertulit)
Spread your fire (Et morte vitam reddidit)
