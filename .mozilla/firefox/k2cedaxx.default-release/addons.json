Because of the fact that hijackers abused the preference in the past, Mozilla decided to remove it. Fortunately, by removing it, Mozilla also introduced a new API to bring this functionality back to life as an add-on. This add-on allows the user to choose a certain page in a new tab. New Tab Override, today with more than 150,000 users, was the first add-on providing this functionality and is therefore the original.\n\nNew Tab Override is a WebExtension and also compatible with Firefox 61 and later.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE FOR USERS OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS - PLEASE READ\n\nNew Tab Override was developed from the ground up as so-called WebExtension. This makes New Tab Override compatible with Firefox 57 and later. Not all options of the previous version are currently available as WebExtension. As soon as Mozilla implements support for missing functionalities in Firefox, they will be integrated in a future update of New Tab Override.\n\nFeatures\n\n    change the new tab page to whatever web accesible URL you like\n    use your current home page as new tab page\n    use any color as background color for the new tab page\n    store a local HTML file in the extension's storage and use the content as new tab content\n    get the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page (only in German language)\n    set the focus either to the address bar or to the web page (for example Google search field)\n    beautiful settings UI to make it easy to customize your new tab experience\n    automatically prepend http:// if protocol is missing\n    can be used together with the container tabs feature of Firefox\n\n\nShortcuts\n\nThe settings interface can also be accessed via the keyboard. For this purpose the combination Shift + F12 is reserved. It is also possible to open the settings interface via entering newtab settings in the address bar or via the menu entry in the tools menu.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThere are already some new features planned for the future. Please suggest your feature requests in the issues tracker.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe extension is currently available in the following languages:\n\n    English\n    German\n    French (Thanks, SuperPat45 and Mozilla commmunity!)\n    Chinese, Simplified (Thanks, tiansh and Mozilla commmunity!)\n    Spanish (Thanks, MissingUser and Mozilla commmunity!)\n    Italian (Thanks, Mozilla commmunity!)\n    Dutch (Thanks, Tonnes!)\n    Brazilian Portuguese (Thanks, Mozilla commmunity!)\n    Swedish (Thanks, Sopor-!)\n    Polish (Thanks, WaldiPL!)\n    Upper Sorbian (Thanks, milupo!)\n    Lower Sorbian (Thanks, milupo!)\n\n\nPermissions\n\nNew Tab Override needs several permissions to work properly. Some permissions are mandatory, some are optional. To give you full transparency this overview also lists \"silent\" permissions.\n\nmandatory permissions\n\nNew Tab Override does not work without the following permissions:\n\n- access browser history\n(since 9.0.0)\n\nThe permission to access the browser history is needed to prevent spammy \"moz-extension://\" entries in your browsing history every time you open a new tab. There is no way to prevent this without this permission.\n\n- access browser tabs\n\nThe permission to access the browser tabs is needed so that New Tab Override can jump to the already opened settings page if the settings page is already opened in another tab and you click the button to open New Tab Override's settings.\n\noptional permissions\n\nThese permissions are not needed to install and use New Tab Override. New Tab Override asks you at runtime once one of these permissions is needed:\n\n- access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at\n\nThe permission to access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at is only needed if you enable the option to see the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page. If enabled, New Tab Override reads the feed of www.soeren-hentzschel.at to show you the latest news.\n\n- read and modify browser settings\n(since 9.0.0)\n\nThe permission to read and modify browser settings is only needed if you enable the option to automatically use your home page as new tab page. Without this permission New Tab Override does not know your home page and you have to manually set your home page as new tab page.\n\nsilent permissions\n\nNew Tab Override needs some more permissions, but Firefox does not prompt for the following permissions:\n\n- cookies\n(since 10.0.0)\n\nThe cookies permission is needed to prevent the loss of the container information if the option \"Set focus to the web page instead of the address bar\" and the container tabs feature of Firefox are used.\n\n- menus\n(since 10.0.0)\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an menu entry in the tools menu for accessing New Tab Override's settings.\n\n- storage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that New Tab Override can store settings such as your new tab page.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe extension requires at least Firefox 61. There is no support for older versions of Firefox.","weeklyDownloads":5552,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Sören Hentzschel","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/1351101/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187261.png?modified=1543520348","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187261.png?modified=1543520348","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187262.png?modified=1543520349","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187262.png?modified=1543520349","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187263.png?modified=1543520350","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187263.png?modified=1543520350","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187264.png?modified=1543520351","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187264.png?modified=1543520351","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187265.png?modified=1543520351","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187265.png?modified=1543520351","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187266.png?modified=1543520352","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187266.png?modified=1543520352","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":364}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/agenedia/3","averageRating":4.401,"reviewCount":401,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/reviews/","updateDate":1546101607000},{"id":"{d7742d87-e61d-4b78-b8a1-b469842139fa}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-32.png?modified=1557736802","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-64.png?modified=1557736802","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-128.png?modified=1557736802"},"name":"Vimium-FF","version":"1.64.6","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/2985278/vimium_ff-1.64.6-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/philc/vimium","supportURL":"https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc","description":"The Hacker's Browser.

Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on Vim.\n\nThis addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.","fullDescription":"Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on VIM.\nMost common tasks you want your browser to perform are bound to a single key\npress:\n\n    You want to open a new tab? Hit t.\n    You want to follow that link? Hit f and type the displayed label.\n    You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit G. Or the top? gg.\n    You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? gi.\n    Switch to the next tab? gt.\n    Go back in time? H.\n    Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? d.\n    Regret that decision? u restores it.\n    Want to write something in Vim? Ctrl-i in a text box opens it in Vim, if\n    you have :native working.\n    Temporarily disable all that magic because you can't stand it? Shift-Insert.\n    But how do you use your browser now? Shift-Insert again and we're back on.\n\nThe list could go on a bit here, but I guess you'll get the point. If you feel\nlost sometimes :help might help you a lot.\nHighlighted features:\n\n    follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.\n    switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.\n    easy customizable search settings\n    bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking\n    great default bindings (if you're used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator)\n\nThis add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend\nto implement the majority of Vimperator's features.\nYou can get beta builds from our website.\nPermissions:\nSince Tridactyl aims to provide all the features Vimperator and Pentadactyl\nhad, it requires quite a few permissions. Here we describe the specific\npermissions and why we need them.\n\n    Access your data for all websites:\n        This is Mozilla's way of saying that Tridactyl can read the content of web\n        pages. This is necessary in order to e.g. find the links you can follow\n        with the :hint command (bound to f by default).\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox\n        This permission is required for Tridactyl to interact with your\n        operating system (opening your editor to edit text areas, sending links to\n        your video player, reading a configuration file from your disk...). This\n        is possible thanks to an external executable we provide. If you feel this\n        gives Tridactyl too much power you can chose not to install the external\n        executable: Tridactyl will still work but won't be able to start external\n        programs.\n    Read and modify bookmarks:\n        Tridactyl's command line has a powerful autocompletion mechanism. In\n        order to be able to autocomplete your bookmarks, Tridactyl needs to read\n        them.\n    Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data:\n        Tridactyl implements the :sanitise command Vimperator and Pentadactyl\n        had. It works a bit like the \"Clear All History\" dialog you can access by\n        pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del on default Firefox.\n    Get data from the clipboard:\n        If your clipboard contains a URL, pressing p will make Tridactyl follow\n        this URL in the current tab.\n    Input data to the clipboard:\n        Tridactyl lets you copy various elements to the clipboard such as a page's\n        URL with yy, a link's URL with ;y or the content of an HTML element\n        with ;p.\n    Download files and read and modify the browser's download history:\n        By pressing ;s, ;S, ;a and ;A you can save documents and pictures\n        from a page to your download folder.\n    Access browsing history:\n        The URLs of websites you've visited previously can be suggested as\n        arguments for :tabopen and similar commands.\n    Access recently closed tabs:\n        If you've accidentally closed a tab or window, Tridactyl will let you open\n        it again with the :undo command which is bound to u by default.\n    Access browser tabs:\n        Tridactyl provides a quick tab-switching menu/command with the :buffer\n        command (bound to b). This permission is also required to close, move,\n        and pin tabs, amongst other things.\n    Access browser activity during navigation:\n        This is needed for Tridactyl to be able to go back to normal mode every\n        time you open a new page. In the future we may use it for autocommands.","weeklyDownloads":479,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Colin
